# Secure-Password-Generator

## Description

In this project I was tasked with building an execution logic in Javascript with some starter code provided in order to create an application that could enable a user to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected.

The primary problems that I solved were creating a logical structure starting with user inputs that would eventually generate a code according to their specifications. To accomplish this I had to demonstrate a working knowledge of conditional statements, iterations, functions, arrays and other elementary programming tasks.
